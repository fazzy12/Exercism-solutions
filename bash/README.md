## Introduction
Bash is a powerful command-line interpreter that is widely used for automating tasks and scripting on Linux and Unix-based systems. It is a great tool for solving problems that involve working with the file system, processing text, and interacting with other command-line utilities.

## Usage
If you are looking for a solution to a specific exercise on Exercism that is written in Bash, you can browse the subdirectory to see if I have a solution available. Each exercise will have its own directory containing the solution in the Bash scripting language.

Please note that these solutions are only intended to be used as reference material. It is important to try to solve the exercise on your own before looking at the solutions.
